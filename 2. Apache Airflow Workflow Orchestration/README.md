# Apache Airflow Workflow Orchestration
## Introduction
### Airflow Usage

![fig1 - airflow usage]()

This image represents an **Apache Airflow DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph)**, a key concept in orchestrating data workflows.

**1. DAG Structure in Airflow**
- The diagram shows **tasks** in an **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)** pipeline.
- Tasks are connected using **dependencies** (arrows), defining execution order.

**2. Breakdown of Tasks**
- **extract** → Retrieves raw data.
- **transform** → Cleans or processes the extracted data.
- **load** → Stores the transformed data into a database or warehouse.
- **query_print** → Likely executes a query or prints results.

**3. Key Airflow Concepts Demonstrated**
- **Operators**: Each box represents a task, typically implemented using Airflow **operators** like:
  - `PythonOperator` (for Python functions)
  - `BashOperator` (for shell commands)
  - `SqlOperator` (for database queries)
- **Task Dependencies**:
  - `extract` runs first.
  - `transform` depends on `extract`.
  - `load` and `query_print` both depend on `transform`, meaning they run in parallel after it completes.
- **DAG Execution**:
  - Airflow schedules and executes tasks in the defined sequence, ensuring dependencies are respected.

## Airflow Fundamental Concepts
### Fundamental Concepts

![fig2 - fundamental concepts]()

**1. DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph)**
A **DAG** is the **overall workflow definition** in Airflow. It consists of multiple tasks and defines their dependencies.

- DAGs **do not execute tasks directly** but organize them.
- They define the **order of execution**.

**2. Tasks**
A **task** is a unit of work in an Airflow DAG. Each task performs a specific function and can be an:
- **Operator**: Executes a specific action (e.g., run a Python script, execute SQL).
- **Sensor**: Waits for an external condition (e.g., file arrival, database update).

**3. Operators**
Operators define **what a task does**. Some common types include:
- `PythonOperator`: Runs a Python function.
- `BashOperator`: Executes a shell command.
- `SqlOperator`: Runs SQL queries.

**4. Sensors**
Sensors are **special operators that wait for an event** before proceeding. Examples:
- `FileSensor`: Waits for a file to appear.
- `ExternalTaskSensor`: Waits for another Airflow task to complete.

**How These Concepts Connect**
- **Operators & Sensors** define **Tasks**.
- **Tasks** form **DAGs** by establishing dependencies.

This modular approach allows **dynamic, scheduled, and automated workflows** in **Apache Airflow**.
